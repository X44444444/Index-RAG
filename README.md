## 🔥 Why i-RAG Will Transform Your RAG Applications

**Tired of RAG systems that can't tell you where their information comes from?** i-RAG solves the fundamental problem of citation accuracy in RAG by embedding document locations alongside content.

### 🎯 The Problem with Traditional RAG
- **Lost Citations**: Standard RAG chunks documents arbitrarily, making it impossible to provide precise source locations
- **Hallucinated Sources**: Systems claim information comes from "page 5" when they don't actually track page numbers
- **Slow Reasoning-Based Alternatives**: Solutions like [VectifyAI/PageIndex](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex) sacrifice speed for accuracy
- **Citation Gaps**: Critical limitations exposed in [recent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13975)

### 🚀 i-RAG: The Breakthrough Solution

i-RAG introduces **paragraph-level indexing with multi-question-based embeddings** - a fundamentally better approach that addresses all major RAG limitations while maintaining lightning-fast retrieval.

## Why store index:

We store multiple embeddings per paragraph based on AI-generated questions and the original paragraph text. If each embedding is stored with its text, the storage space used increases. Storing text locations helps in precise citations including file name, page number, and line number without needing to store the entire text multiple times.

## ✨ Revolutionary Advantages

### 🎯 **Precise Citations Made Easy**
- **Exact Location Tracking**: Every retrieved result includes document URL, page number, and line number
- **Source Transparency**: No more guessing - know exactly where your AI's information comes from
- **Academic-Grade Citations**: Perfect for research, legal, and compliance applications

### 🧠 **Addresses Critical RAG Limitations**
- **Solves Citation Accuracy Issues**
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Built to handle the next generation of citation requirements

### ⚡ **Superior Performance vs. Alternatives**
- **Faster than Reasoning-Based RAG**: I-RAG delivers speed while maintaining accuracy
- **Multiple Retrieval Pathways**: Question-based embeddings create numerous entry points per paragraph. Duplicate or consecutive chunks can be merged to optimize context for accurate question-answering.
- **Lightweight Setup**: No need for complex reasoning models or extensive infrastructure
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large document collections with ease

## 🛠️ Quick Start: Get Started in Minutes

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pinecone account
- API keys for Cohere and OpenAI

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pro-GenAI/Index-RAG
cd Index-RAG
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your API keys in .env
```

### Launch Your Citation-Accurate RAG System
```bash
# Host the embedding models
python index_rag/host_models.py &

# Ingest documents with precise location tracking
python -c "from index_rag.utils.ingestion import ingest_document; ingest_document('your-document.pdf')"

# Start the RAG API server for an OpenAI-compatible API
python index_rag/utils/server.py &
```

### Query with Perfect Citations
```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
	api_key="dummy",
	base_url="http://localhost:8001/v1"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
	model="RAG-app",
	messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is compound interest?"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
# Sample output: "According to Investopedia (investopedia.pdf, page 12, line 45),
# compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit calculated based ..."
```
